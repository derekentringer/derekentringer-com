## Architecture Decisions

- **Tauri over Electron** — ~5MB bundle vs ~150MB; native performance; Rust backend for file system and SQLite access
- **Offline-first** — SQLite holds a full local copy of all notes; app is fully functional without internet
- **Login required** — authenticates against ns-api; shared accounts across web, desktop, and mobile; app needs connectivity for initial login, then works offline
- **Sync engine** — background sync between local SQLite and central PostgreSQL via ns-api; pending change queue with last-write-wins conflict resolution based on `updatedAt` timestamps
- **One-time .txt import** — migration wizard scans a local folder, previews files, imports into local SQLite, then syncs to central DB; no ongoing file watching
- **Google Drive import is one-time** — OAuth, pick a folder, import .txt files into local SQLite, done; not a live sync
- **CodeMirror 6 for markdown editing** — source editing with syntax highlighting, optional split-pane preview; no WYSIWYG
- **Custom AI editor extension** — `@derekentringer/codemirror-ai-markdown` is a standalone, backend-agnostic CodeMirror 6 extension; publishable to npm if desired; NoteSync wires it to Claude via ns-api
- **AI calls go through ns-api** — desktop never calls Claude directly; all AI requests route through the Fastify API
- **No code signing** — personal tool; users dismiss one-time OS warnings on first launch
- **Notes stored as markdown** — raw markdown in the database; editor shows source with syntax highlighting

- [x] [18 — Dashboard](features/18-dashboard.md) — Rich dashboard replaces empty editor state when no note is selected, showing Quick Actions (New Note, New Recording, Import File), Resume Editing hero card, horizontal-scroll Favorites/Recently Edited/Audio Notes sections, `audioMode` field (SQLite migration 010 + db.ts + upsert), macOS legacy scrollbar mode via Rust NSUserDefaults (`objc2-foundation`), scrollbar fade animation via CSS `@property --scroll-thumb-color` scoped to scrollable containers only (`.overflow-y-auto`/`.overflow-x-auto`/`.overflow-auto`/`.markdown-preview`), sidebar `overflow-x-hidden`, title/summary `overflow-hidden` to prevent jitter, tag browser `transition-[max-height,opacity]` replacing `transition-all` to avoid hover jitter, `cursor-pointer` on tag suggestion buttons, 14 new tests

- [x] Interactive markdown checkboxes — GFM task list checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) in preview and split modes are now clickable; toggling a checkbox updates the underlying markdown content and triggers autosave; DOM-based index lookup at click time for reliable checkbox identification across React re-renders; trash view checkboxes remain disabled (read-only); `toggleCheckbox` utility with full test coverage, MarkdownPreview `onContentChange` prop with 3 new component tests

- [x] [19 — Code Block Copy Button](features/19-code-block-copy-button.md) — Hover-reveal "Copy" button on fenced code blocks in markdown preview, copies code to clipboard via `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`, checkmark feedback for 2s, `CodeBlock` component as react-markdown `pre` override, refactored `markdownComponents` to always build (copy button works in trash view), inline SVG icons (clipboard + checkmark), CSS opacity transition on hover, 5 new tests

- [x] [20 — Syntax Highlighting](features/20-syntax-highlighting.md) — Syntax highlighting in fenced code blocks via `rehype-highlight` + `highlight.js`, custom CSS theme with 6 token color variables (keyword/string/comment/number/function/variable), automatic dark/light theme support via CSS custom properties, applied to both MarkdownPreview and QAPanel components, inline code unaffected, 4 new tests

- [x] [21 — Mermaid Diagram Rendering](features/21-mermaid-diagram-rendering.md) — Fenced ` ```mermaid ` code blocks render as visual SVG diagrams via `mermaid.render()`, lazy-loaded (~2MB library only loads when a mermaid block is present), theme-aware (dark/light) with automatic re-render on theme change via MutationObserver + matchMedia, `MermaidDiagram` component with error fallback (raw code + error message), `CodeBlock` language detection delegates mermaid to renderer, `QAPanel` gains CodeBlock component for mermaid + copy button in AI answers, 4 new tests

### Audio Recording Reliability

- [x] macOS microphone entitlement — Added `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to `src-tauri/Info.plist` for macOS `getUserMedia({ audio: true })` permission; without this key the microphone prompt never appears in WKWebView and recording throws `NotAllowedError`

- [x] MediaRecorder MIME type detection — Replaced hardcoded `audio/webm;codecs=opus` with runtime `getSupportedMimeType()` that tries webm/opus, webm, mp4, ogg/opus in order; required for WebKit/WKWebView which doesn't support `audio/webm;codecs=opus`; dynamic file extension in `transcribeAudio` client based on blob MIME type

- [x] Audio upload retry logic — `transcribeAudio` client retries up to 2 times with exponential backoff on 502/503/504 status codes; handles transient Whisper API failures gracefully

- [x] Core Audio HAL migration — Migrated meeting audio recording through three iterations: (1) ScreenCaptureKit (`screencapturekit` crate) broke on macOS Tahoe due to stricter TCC enforcement for "Screen & System Audio Recording"; (2) `cpal` crate loopback worked but triggered ~12 permission dialogs because cpal internally makes many Core Audio HAL calls that each trigger TCC checks; (3) direct Core Audio HAL via `coreaudio-rs` + `objc2-core-audio` + `core-foundation` gives full control over the HAL call sequence. Final implementation: permissions pre-requested once each (mic via AVCaptureDevice + system audio via `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap`) before any AudioUnit setup, then creates Process Tap → Aggregate Device → two independent AudioUnits (system + mic) — resulting in exactly 2 permission dialogs on first use. Changes: replaced `cpal` with `coreaudio-rs` + `core-foundation` in Cargo.toml, rewrote `audio_capture.rs` with direct AudioUnit/Process Tap/Aggregate Device management, raw FFI declarations for `AudioHardwareCreateAggregateDevice`/`AudioHardwareDestroyAggregateDevice`. Zero frontend changes — same Tauri commands, events, and return types.

- [x] Disk-streaming audio capture — Rewrote `audio_capture.rs` to stream audio samples to temporary raw PCM files on disk during recording instead of accumulating in `Arc<Mutex<Vec<f32>>>` buffers. At 48kHz stereo, a 1.5-hour recording accumulated ~2GB per stream in memory; on stop, `.clone()` + `to_mono()` + `resample()` + `mix()` each allocated full-size buffers, peaking at 8–10GB+ and triggering macOS force-quit. New architecture: `mpsc::sync_channel(128)` pairs feed dedicated `spawn_writer_thread()` functions that write raw f32 PCM bytes to `/tmp/notesync_{sys,mic}_{ts}.pcm` via `BufWriter`. On stop, `mix_to_wav()` reads both temp files in 1-second chunks, converts to mono, downsamples to 16kHz (Whisper's native rate — no quality loss, ~1.9 MB/min output), resamples via stateful `ChunkResampler` (linear interpolation preserving fractional position across chunk boundaries), mixes by averaging, and writes WAV — ~2MB working set regardless of recording length. Temp files cleaned up after WAV is written. Zero frontend changes.

- [x] 16kHz WAV downsampling + upload limit fix — WAV output downsampled from native 48kHz to 16kHz (Whisper's internal rate — zero quality loss), reducing file size from ~5.6 MB/min to ~1.9 MB/min. A 45-min recording produces ~86MB instead of ~259MB. Raised ns-api Fastify body + multipart limits from 100MB to 500MB so large recordings reach the server-side audio chunker (which splits into 24MB segments for Whisper). Max recording duration extended from 2 to 4 hours (both desktop + web AudioRecorder).

- [x] Ad-hoc code signing — Added `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY=-` to `tauri:build:prod` script. Without code signing, macOS TCC had no stable app identity to persist permissions, causing permission dialogs on every recording. Ad-hoc signing gives the app a stable `CDHash` so TCC remembers grants — 2 dialogs on first use after install, 0 on subsequent recordings.

- [x] System audio permission pre-request — Added `request_system_audio_permission()` function that creates a minimal global stereo tap via `CATapDescription::initStereoGlobalTapButExcludeProcesses:` just to trigger the macOS "System Audio Recording" TCC dialog, then destroys the tap. Called in `start_recording()` before any AudioUnit setup, alongside the existing `request_microphone_permission()`. Ensures exactly 2 clean permission dialogs on first use (mic + system audio) before any HAL operations begin.

### Note Save Reliability

- [x] Optimistic note save on tab/note switch — Fire-and-forget saves in `selectNote()` and `closeTab()` now optimistically update the `notes` array and `tabNoteCacheRef` before the async DB write. Previously, switching away from a dirty note saved to DB but left the in-memory `notes` array and tab cache with stale content; switching back would load the old version from the stale array. `handleSave()` also now updates `tabNoteCacheRef` after save so tab switching always has fresh data. Same fix applied to ns-web for parity.

- [x] Stale reloadNotes race condition fix — Added monotonic request counter (`reloadNotesCounterRef`) to `reloadNotes()` / `loadNotes()` so only the latest async fetch applies `setNotes()`. Previously, a `reloadNotes()` started before a save (e.g. from sync callback or periodic refresh) could complete after the save and replace the `notes` array with stale data; the auto-refresh effect would then see `contentChanged && !isDirty()` and overwrite the editor with old content. The counter ensures stale results are silently discarded. Same fix applied to ns-web for parity.

### App Icon Fidelity

- [x] High-fidelity app icons — Regenerated `.icns` from SVG vector source at 1024x1024 via ImageMagick + Apple `iconutil`; previous `.icns` was missing the `ic10` (1024x1024) variant, causing macOS to upscale from 512px in the app switcher, About window, and Applications folder; all 10 required iconset sizes (16–1024px @1x and @2x) now embedded

- [x] Icon padding for macOS task switcher — Artwork resized to 824x824 centered on 1024x1024 canvas (~100px transparent padding per side, Apple's 13/16 rule); all icon formats regenerated (`.icns`, `.ico`, all PNGs); forced 8-bit/color RGBA (`PNG32`) depth — ImageMagick's default 16-bit depth caused `tao` (Tauri's windowing library) to panic during `did_finish_launching` because the `image` crate doesn't handle 16-bit PNGs for window icons

- [x] Recording source selector fix — AudioRecorder dropdown source items (`Microphone only` / `Meeting mode`) were `<div>` elements with no click handler; changed to `<button>` elements with `onRecordingSourceChange` callback wired to `updateAiSetting("recordingSource", src)` in NotesPage; users can now switch recording source from the dropdown

- [x] Unrestricted sidebar panel resizing — Removed min/max constraints on the folder/favorites panel resize divider so users can drag the notes list area to any height; `folderResize` minSize lowered to 0 (fully collapsible) and maxSize raised to 2000px

### Phase 9: Hardening — Low Priority

- [ ] [13 — Architecture Hardening](feature_planning/13-architecture-hardening.md)

### Phase 10: Local File Support — Low Priority

- [x] [15 — Local File Support](features/15-local-file-support.md) — Local file linking with bidirectional sync, import choice dialog (Import to NoteSync / Keep Local), three-write save (file + SQLite + sync), file watcher with write suppression + 30s poll backup, external change detection with dialog/auto-reload and hash dedup, missing file detection with red indicators (dot in note list, triangle on tab), local file diff view (unified/split), cross-device cloud_newer detection, delete choice dialog, unlink local file, web app indicator for local file notes, sync push rejection handling, folder unique index fix
